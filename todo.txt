- benchmark whether the CAS queue implementation is actually more
performant than a simple locked queue.

- SBCL and LispWorks already include lock-free queue implementations.
Perhaps use them instead?

- rewrite tests using bordeaux-threads or publish LW MP shim

- add better tests & add tests for count slot(s)

- get rid of dequeued/enqueued-count slots and just use a single count
slot?
